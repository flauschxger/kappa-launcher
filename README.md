Kappa Launcher
============

Kappa Launcher is a simple bash script that uses rofi to display and launch your followed streams

## Features

Displays all live Twitch streams that you follow.

Shows information about these streams, such as the currently played game, number of viewers and title.

Allows you to launch said streams.

Supports streamlink, chatterino, chatty or just plain twitch in a browser.

You can also launch streams you don't follow.

## Instructions

On first launch the script creates a configuration file in .config/kpl. You must then edit this file with your Twitch [OAuth token](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/). If you wish, you can also change the PLAYER and CHAT options.

Once you have done this, simply run the script again and everything should work!
